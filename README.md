# A-Case-Study-Energy-Complexity
This study analyzes the energy efficiency (E(n)) of MergeSort and QuickSort on Apple M2 architecture. While QuickSort is faster for large datasets (N=50,000), it consumes significantly more energy (3.75 J) than MergeSort (2.50 J) due to higher instantaneous power draw. It highlights the need for energy-aware algorithm selection.
